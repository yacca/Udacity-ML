## Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

### Question 1: Identify variables in the experiment
>- Independent variable: ~~word condition (congruent or incongruent)~~ the congruency of the color and text
>- Dependent varaible: ~~Time to name the ink colors~~ duration (time) to recognise the ink colors

*Thanks for the reviewer's suggestions to improve my expressions*

### Question 2a: Establish hypotheses
>We define μ<sub>congruent</sub> as the population mean of duration to name the ink colors in congruent word condition and μ<sub>incongruent</sub> as the population mean of the duration to name the ink colors in incongruent word condition.
>
>- Null hypotheses: It doesn't take longer time to name the ink colors in the incongruent word condition than it does in the congruent word condition.
>
>  H<sub>0</sub> : μ<sub>incongruent</sub> <= μ<sub>congruent</sub>
>
>- Alternative hypotheses: It takes longer time to name the ink colors in the incongruent word condition than it does in the congruent word condition.
>
>  H<sub>A</sub> : μ<sub>incongruent</sub> > μ<sub>congruent</sub>

### Question 2b: Establish a statistical test
>Because we don't know the mean and standard deviation of the population we choose positive direction, one-tailed dependent t test to decide to accept or reject the null hypotheses based on these assumptions:
>
>- the distribution of the duration to name the ink colors is normal
>- the incongruent word condition has impact on the time of naming the ink colors, so we use dependent t test on the same samples (participants) with different conditions
>- we guess the incongruent word condition may slow down the speed of naming the ink colors, so we choose positive (longer time) direction, one-tailed t test

### Question 3: Report descriptive statistics
>- In congruent word condition
>  - Centrality
>    - Sample mean: 14.05
>  - Variability
>    - Standard deviation: 3.56
>- In incongruent word condition
>  - Centrality
>    - Sample mean: 22.02
>  - Variability
>    - Standard deviation: 4.80
>- The difference of two conditions
>  - Centrality
>    - Difference of the sample mean: 7.96
>  - Variability
>    - Standard deviation of the difference: 4.86

### Question 4: Plot the data
>![Plot of naming time](Congruent_Incongruent.png)
>
>We can see the time to name the ink colors in incongruent word condition is longer than that in congruent condition for all participants. So I think the incongruent condition will increase the reaction time.

### Question 5: Perform the statistical test and interpret your results
>The result of given test:
>
>- t(23)=8.02, p<0.0001,one-tailed
>
>If we choose 0.05 (5%) as the α level since p is less than 0.05 we reject the null hypotheses. 
>
>I performed a test on 6 participants and get the following results:
>
>- Number of samples: 6
>- Degrees of freedom: 5
>- Difference of sample mean: 27.32
>- Standard deviation of the difference: 20.33
>- t value: 3.29
>- p value: 0.01085
>
>The p is less than 0.05 too.
>
>So I think these results show that the incongruent word condition statistically significantly slow down the speed of naming the ink colors.
